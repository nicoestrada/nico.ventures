# Algorithms

Just a list of algorithms that I come across and find fascinating enough to leave here with my thoughts and gatherings of them.

## [Boyer-Moore Majority Vote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boyer%E2%80%93Moore_majority_vote_algorithm)
This algorithm solves the problem of finding the majority element in an array of numbers, in linear time. The idea of it is creating a variable to save the element, a counter variable initialized to 0, and iterating through each element in the array. 

If the counter is 0, set the saved element variable to the current element. Otherwise, set the counter to an addition assignment (+=) to a ternary statement of if the current element equals the saved element variable then by 1 else by -1.

It will return the saved element variable which will be the majority, if there is one. This can be done in one pass but can be ensured in two passes to confirm. It will take O(n) time based on number of elements and occupy O(1) space.
