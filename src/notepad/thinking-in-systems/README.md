# Thinking in Systems

Resource: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Systems-Donella-H-Meadows/dp/1603580557">Thinking in Systems by Donella H. Meadows.</a>

As an early-career software engineer, I am striving to improve the depth of knowledge that I have in systems as much as I can . This is one of my efforts to achieve that. I believe learning about thinking in systems will benefit my craft as a developer and help me make better technical and organizational decisions when I build products and make contributions that I hope to be useful and meaningful in the future. 

I use tip boxes to highlight relevant quotes that stood out to me.

## Introduction

::: tip 
"Systems happen all at once. They are connected not just in one direction, but in many directions simultaneously."
:::

Everything within a system contributing to the system's output -- good or bad and directionless. 

:::tip
The basic operating unit of a system -- the feedback loop.
:::

Perhaps keep this at the central thought process when making decisions on a product.

::: tip
I don't think the systems way of seeing is better than the reductionist way of thinking. I think it's complementary, and therefore revealing. 
:::

Gaining a holistic perspective can be advantageous, especially if one wants help navigating through the current age of emerging technoliges. 

::: tip
The behavior of a system cannot be known just by knowing the elements of which the system is made.
:::

Things don't appear to be so simple of dissecting a system by simply knowing what it's made of. There's more to it, probably a lot more.
