# Programming in Haskell

Resource: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Haskell-Graham-Hutton/dp/1316626229/ref=pd_lpo_sccl_1/138-4036375-8183555?pd_rd_i=1316626229&psc=1">Programming in Haskell</a>

A quick preface before I start the Programming Languages and Compilers course at UIUC this Summer 2024.

## Introduction

- In general, the order in which functions are applied in a calculation does not affect the value of the final result, but it may affect the number of steps required, and whether the calculation process terminates.

- As a higher-order language, functions can freely take functions as arguments and produce functions as results.

- Being able to define generic functions that can be used with different kinds of effects is a key feature of Haskell.
