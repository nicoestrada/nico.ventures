# Mental Models

A personal collection of mental models that I have gathered over time. Usually as I embark new endeavors, my decision making abilities are strengthened by the effectiveness of these models. As those decisions over time become more critical, the underlying thought process is relatively the same.

I have found that the best way to develop new mental models is to read science, math and philosphy.

## Evolution
### Charles Darwin, Richard Dawkins

## Falsifiability

## Game Theory

## Microeconomics
### Adam Smith, von Mises, Hayek
### Compound Interest

### Principal-Agent Problem
Julius Caesar famously said, “If you want it done, then go. And if not, then send.” What he meant was, if you want it done right, then you have to go yourself and
do it. When you are the principal, then you are the owner—you
care, and you will do a great job. When you are the agent and
you are doing it on somebody else’s behalf, you can do a bad
job. You just don’t care. You optimize for yourself rather than
for the principal’s assets.
The smaller the company, the more everyone feels like a prin-
cipal. The less you feel like an agent, the better the job you’re
going to do. The more closely you can tie someone’s compensa-
tion to the exact value they’re creating, the more you turn them
into a principal, and the less you turn them into an agent.
