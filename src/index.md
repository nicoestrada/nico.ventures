## Software Engineer, Founder ðŸ¤ 

#### Hi, I'm Nico! I like to build greenfield projects and start small companies for fun.<br /><br />
I'm originally from Austin, TX. I graduated at Loyola University Chicago in Web Technologies, a hybrid program between Computer Science and Software Engineering. <br /><br />In my free time I enjoy learning new things, exploring new places, and hanging out.
