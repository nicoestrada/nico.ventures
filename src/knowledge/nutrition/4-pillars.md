## About this article

Most of this article was written when I was very young. I wanted to "go down the rabbit hole" of ethics without first reading about it. In doing so, I wanted to come up with a framework where society could judge the ethics of a person and of an action.

## Introduction

- Why should I act ethically?
- What do the words 'good', 'bad', 'right' and 'wrong' mean?
- Are moral judgments universal or relative, of one kind or many kinds?
- How we can know if something is right or wrong, if at all?

Ethics involves systematizing, defending and recommending concepts of right and wrong conduct. It attempts to answer questions like: "is it wrong to have an abortion?".

In essence, ethics fulfills two objectives. It gives us:

- A means to discern what is right and wrong (Descriptive, Meta, & Normative ethics)
- A means to apply that judgement to conduct (Applied ethics)

This is not altogether different from any western legal system. There are two facets: the laws (right & wrong); and the judicial system (for example, court procedings). A legal system is really a society's moral framework, but, as rational humans, we shouldn't just rely on society to tell what is ethical.


## The Four Pillars

Four Pillars of Nutrition according to Deep Nutrition:

1. [Meta-ethics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-ethics): What does "right" even mean? This field is useful for analysing moral dilemmas. It has the ambition of providing a non-biased, scientific approach to judging inherently unjudgable situations.
2. [Descriptive ethics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descriptive_ethics): What do people think is right? This is the study of people's beliefs about morality at a given time and place. 
3. **Normative (prescriptive) ethics**: How should people act?
4. **Applied ethics**: How do we take moral knowledge and put it into practice?
