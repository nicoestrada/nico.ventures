Summary: Part of my final exam study for CS421

## Higher Order Functions
- These are functions that can be applied to other functions

These are highly useful and I should read more about each one as they can do a lot of the heavy lifting in functional programming.

Some examples to note here, 
- **Map**
	- Doing something to every element of a list, changing the type of the result list
- **Folding**
	- Applying a lambda function 
	- Must specify the function and the base case
	- Usually the acc should be the second argument
- **zipWith**
	- takes two lists as arguments, compares each element, truncates to shorter list
- **all
- **any**
- **takeWhile**
- **dropWhile**
- **flip**
